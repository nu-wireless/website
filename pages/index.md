## Who are we?

![](/img/club-s24.webp)

Founded in 1922, we are Northeastern University’s longest-running student organization! Originally *just* an amateur radio club, we're now so much more. From electronics education through outreach and workshops, to amazing projects and speakers, plus **free** licensing exams, we are Northeastern University's premier electronics experimentation club.

## Weekly Meetings

We meet every Thursday at 7 PM in our lab space in Hayden Hall, Room 503 (Northeastern’s Boston campus). Meetings are open to all, with no prior experience needed, and include free pizza plus engaging talks from students, professors, alumni, and guest speakers!

## Workshops

Every Monday during the semester, we host hands-on technical workshops, covering topics in electronics, soldering, amateur radio, and more.  
Our Fall 2025 schedule will be announced soon, including the location and time! 

Workshops are run in collaboration with the [Electric Racing](https://electricracing.northeastern.edu/) and [IEEE](https://coe.northeastern.edu/orgs/ieee-institute-of-electrical-and-electronics-engineers-nu-student-chapter/) student organizations.

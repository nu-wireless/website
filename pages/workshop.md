# Workshops

Every Monday at **7:10 PM in Forsyth Building, Room 236**, we run a workshop series covering carefully selected topics
we believe students need for success in engineering, but that aren’t typically taught in class.

## Workshop Descriptions

### Tape Measure Yagi Antenna (Introduction to Amateur "Ham" Radio)
Build a working directional antenna from PVC and tape measures! Learn the basics of radio waves, antenna design, and how
to use your creation to make real on-air contacts. This serves as an excellent introduction to amateur radio and antenna
design.

### Schematic Capture
Turn your ideas into circuits with [KiCad](https://www.kicad.org/)! Learn how to draw a complete schematic, the first
step in creating your own printed circuit board (PCB). This workshop begins our series on PCB development. You will
leave the workshop having drawn a pre-engineered schematic for use in the PCB Design workshop.

### SPICE Circuit Simulation (LTspice)
Before solder touches a board, test it in software. Using your schematic from the previous workshop, simulate and
analyze your circuit in a free SPICE-based circuit simulator,
[LTspice](https://www.analog.com/en/resources/design-tools-and-calculators/ltspice-simulator.html), to predict
performance.

### PCB Design (KiCad)
This workshop will take you through the process of designing a printed circuit board. You'll learn about the different
types of component footprints, layers, routing, traces and more! No previous workshop attendance is needed.

### Introduction to Soldering (Through-hole)
Learn an essential electrical engineering skill: soldering! We provide all of the tools, materials, and a custom
instructional circuit that you will assemble and test! Uses the much easier to solder "through hole" components.

### Advanced Soldering (Surface-mount)
While through hole components may be good enough for hobby projects, most modern devices use SMD aka "surface-mount
device" components. You will once again build a custom circuit, this time with SMD components!

### Introduction to Git
Version control made easy. Learn what [Git](https://git-scm.com/) is and how to use it. We will also teach you how to
track changes, collaborate with others, and safeguard your work using both Git and [GitHub](https://github.com/).

### LaTeX
Learn [LaTeX](https://www.latex-project.org/) (pronounced "Lah-tech" or "Lay-tech"), the typesetting system that
engineers, scientists, and academics use to create professional documents, papers, and presentations.

### Embedded Development
Embedded devices are everywhere today. In this workshop you will implement some simple code on a wireless club custom
embedded board using a variety of protocols.

### Bare Metal Embedded Development on STM32
Arduino isn't really used in industry, so what is? Well that would be the STM32 platform. We'll first learn the super
nitty gritty using assembly to interface with familiar sensors and input devices, and then learn how to generate an
embedded C HAL (hardware abstraction layer) for easier development work. No experience required!

    TEMP: 'open' attribute is used so past semester accordions 
    are expanded by default during current testing/launch.
    Remove 'open' once we have several semesters listed to
